# The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850s and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in certain populations.

#It is computed by taking an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters.

# BMI = mass/height**2

#create a BMi fucntion that calculates your own BMI

mass = 70.5 
height = 1.63

bmi = mass/height**2
